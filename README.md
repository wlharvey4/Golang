## About This Source File

This  document (`my_template.twjr`)  is  a *literate*  source  document. It  is
designed to produce an `Info` file (best read from within Emacs, but there is a
stand-alone Info  reader that can  be used),  a `Pdf` document  (generated from
LaTeX source  code by PDFTeX),  an `HTML` web  site, `Docbook` source  code, an
`XML`  document, and  a  plain text  document. In  addition.  it also  produces
working  code   in  any  language  (so   long  as  your  system   contains  the
infrastructure to  run the code). For  example, this `README` file  was drafted
within this source document  and extracted as a separate file,  as was also the
`Makefile`.  This *literate*  document's  features are  targeted  via a  custom
`Makefile` that is  also a part of  this document, and extracted  as a separate
file, and is dynamic in the sense that  if you update it, you can produce a new
version with  a simple call to  a `make` target. It  is designed to be  able to
produce any  number of working software  packages of any language  contained at
any  number of  different  locations on  your  system, all  with  a single  or,
alternatively, multiple `make` calls, depending on the granularity you need.

The Github  repository contains this  source document,  a Makefile that  can be
used  to work  with the  project, as  well as  a `Texinfo`  file that  has been
generated from  this `Twjr` file,  this README,  and a `.gitignore`  file. Most
computer systems have or can easily get the `make`, and `texinfo` programs that
are needed to  process the `Texinfo` file into the  various end documents, such
as `Info`,  `Pdf`, `HTML`, etc. Your  system will need, in  addition to `make`,
and `texinfo`, Gnu  AWK (`gawk`), and TexiwebJr to make  changes to this source
document and  process it  into a  `Texinfo` file and  extract its  programs and
files.  Your system  should also  have  the equivalent  of Bash  version 4,  as
version 4  has some parameter capabilities  that earlier versions do  not. Note
that most  versions of Mac OS  have version 3  of Bash installed as  a default.
Version 4 can be added using Homebrew or MacPorts very easily. In the past, Mac
OS has  also shipped with a  version of `texinfo`  that is below 6.5.  You will
also need to update `texinfo` to at least 6.5 if that is the case.
